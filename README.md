While trouble shooting the website, discovered the "search-engine-optimization" link was unresponsive.  Added an id tag to ensure that the link worked properly.

Spaced out certain code lines in the HTML to give the code tree a more streamlined and less jumbled together look while also renaming certain tags.

In the CSS style sheet, there were quite a few redundant functions that created an unnecessarily long CSS list.  Combined and removed the redundant functions and reduced the overall line amount.
